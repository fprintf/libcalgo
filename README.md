Common algorithm implementations for C, also designed to be simple
and have very easy to use interfaces (design is focused on ease of use
for users of the library)

== Features
* Hash tables
* Linked lists
* Vector lists
* Balanced btree (TODO) (RedBlack for ease of implementation)
* Grid structures (likely)
* Ropes (maybe)
